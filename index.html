                    Pumpkin is a type of winter squash that’s in the same plant family as cucumbers and melons. It’s
                    technically a fruit since it contains seeds. Yet, in terms of nutrition, it’s more like a vegetable.
                    Pumpkins are usually round and orange, although the size, shape, and color can vary depending on the
                    variety. They have a thick outer rind that’s smooth and ribbed, as well as a stem that connects the
                    pumpkin to its leafy plant. Inside they’re hollow, except for ivory-colored seeds coated with
                    stringy flesh. These squash are native to North America and play a big role in two holidays. They
                    are carved into jack-o’-lanterns for Halloween and cooked into pies for Thanksgiving dessert in the
                    United States
                    and Canada. However, they’re also grown around the world on every continent except Antarctica. Their
                    seeds, leaves, and flesh are all edible.

                <p class="article__item">
                    Pumpkin seeds have a long history of nutritional use dating back to the Oaxaca Highlands of Mexico
                    over 7,500 years ago. Across many cultures, they’ve been used as a folk remedy to treat urinary
                    tract and bladder infections, high blood pressure and blood sugar, kidney stones, parasites like
                    worms.
                    Modern science confirms that pumpkin seeds have an impressive nutrient profile that benefits many
                    aspects of your health. They’re a rich source of protein, unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins, and
                    minerals that reduce risk factors of chronic diseases, including cancer. You can buy pumpkin seeds
                    raw, spouted, or roasted at most grocery stores and specialty health food retailers. When sold in
                    their green shells, they’re also sometimes called pepitas.

                    Pumpkin seeds are a potent source of many nutrients, offering high levels of essential vitamins and
                    minerals in a small serving. But they also are high in calories, so limit your portions to help
                    manage a healthy weight. Add a handful to your meal for potential health bnefits.
